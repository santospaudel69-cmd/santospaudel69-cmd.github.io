      <h3>Project 1: Researching the Nepal IT Market</h3>
      <p>This project involved studying the current state of the IT sector in Nepal to explore 
      opportunities for starting a new business. I analyzed trends such as the rise of digital 
      services, e-commerce, and software development. The goal was to identify potential areas 
      where entrepreneurs can invest and grow in Nepal’s emerging digital economy.</p>

      <h3>Project 2: Learning Programming for Website & Application Development</h3>
      <p>In this project, I focused on learning programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
      with the aim of developing my own website and applications. This hands-on learning process 
      allowed me to understand how coding works and how digital platforms are built. 
      The project is an ongoing journey where I plan to expand my skills into backend technologies 
      and mobile app development in the future.</p>
